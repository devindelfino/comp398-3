		<H1>Lithia's Webpage</H1>

		<p>My name is Lithia Helmreich. I am a junior at Wheaton College, majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm making this webpage for a 398 course I am taking in the CS department entitled <i>Web Application Development</i>. I guess this page is an applied development for the web? </p>
			<pre>	This is an embedded paragraph. I can do that with HTML2. </pre>
			<pre>	This is another embedded paragraph. I can still do that because my short term memory is fairly effective. </pre>
			<pre>	Snazzy. </pre>
		<p>Here I have changed the font color to blue. I am a fan of blue. Also green, and purple. Really I like all the cool colors, which makes sense because winter is my favorite season.

		<p>Below is a picture of my dog Emy chewing a stick on the pond (in the winter, that's why this is relevant):</p>
